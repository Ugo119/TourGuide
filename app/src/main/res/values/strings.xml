    <string name="abujaDescription">Abuja is the capital city of Nigeria located in the centre of the country within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). It is a planned city and was built mainly in the 1980s,[5] replacing the country's most populous city of Lagos as the capital on 12 December 1991. Abuja's geography is defined by Aso Rock, a 400-metre (1,300 ft) monolith left by water erosion. The Presidential Complex, National Rock, a 792-metre (2,598 ft) monolith, lies just north .</string>
    <string name="blucabana_description">Good Lebanese and international kitchen with tables around the almost oversized pool. Staff friendly and forthcoming. BlueCabana is a great asset to Abuja. Connected to the Nordic Hotel, the facilities are always spotless and everything is in working order. Food - especially the Lebanese options - is fresh and generally delicious. The restaurant has a nice family atmosphere on weekend afternoons and would make a romantic dinner in the evening hours.</string>
